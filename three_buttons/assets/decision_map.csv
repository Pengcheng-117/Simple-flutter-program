Tourist guide project can let users feel the characteristics of tourist attractions more intuitively, through different angles can show users the fun of tourism in all aspects.
First we initialize the content through the database initialization method. Then we present the data through node_view, the data structure has been abstracted as a tree, when the user selects a certain knowledge, we can easily guide to the next node. In this way, the user can receive the knowledge of the tour after a layer of display.
